# Paytm Clone (A try)

## Description

This is my first full-stack project. Through this project, I have tried to implement all the web dev knowledge I have so far.
> * The Application is built with Vite.
> * I have used ReactJS in the frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling.
> * ExpressJS and MongoDB is used in the backend.
> * Essentially, frontend/backend folders are two different projects that need to be compiled seperately.
